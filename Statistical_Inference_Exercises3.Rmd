Problem 1
---------
**Consider again the `mtcars` dataset. Use a two group t-test to test the hypothesis that the 4 and 6 cyl cars have the same `mpg`. Use a two sided test with unequal variances. Give a P-value.**

```{r solution 1}
library(datasets) # load datasets library
data("mtcars") # load mtcars dataset
str(mtcars) # show structure of dataset
fourcyldata <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, ] # subset of 4 cylinder cars
sixcyldata <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 6, ] # subset of 6 cylinder cars
hypothtest <- t.test(fourcyldata$mpg, sixcyldata$mpg, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE) # two sided t test with unequal variances
```

Hence, the two sided t-test with unequal variances take a p-value of `r hypothtest$p.value`
